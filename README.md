# Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains projects and code examples related to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Exploratory Data Analysis is an essential step in the data analysis process, where we examine and understand the characteristics and patterns present in the dataset. Through visualizations, statistical summaries, and data manipulation techniques, EDA helps us gain insights, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions about further analysis and modeling.

## EDA - Gasoline Prices Dataset

The EDA project based on the gasoline.csv dataset focuses on analyzing monthly average retail prices for gasoline and fuel oil in major Canadian cities. The dataset, sourced from Statistics Canada, includes information such as monthly average gasoline price (Cents per Litre) starting from 1979 until recent times. By performing exploratory data analysis, you will gain insights into the price trends, seasonal variations, and geographical differences in gasoline prices across Canada. Furthermore, the project involves the use of the canada_provinces.geojson dataset for creating a choropleth map to visualize the regional variations in gasoline prices.

## Feature Engineering - Ames Housing Dataset

The Feature Engineering project revolves around the Ames Housing dataset, which examines various features of houses sold in Ames, a small city in the state of Iowa, United States, during the 2006â€“2010 timeframe. The dataset (Ames_Housing_Data.tsv) provides a rich set of attributes such as house size, location, condition, and sale price. In this project, you will explore techniques for feature engineering, which involves transforming, creating, or selecting features to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. Through EDA and feature engineering, you will uncover relationships between features, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and potentially create new features to improve the accuracy of housing price predictions.

## Data Cleaning - Ames Housing Dataset

The Data Cleaning project also utilizes the Ames Housing dataset, focusing on preparing the data for further analysis. The dataset provides detailed information about houses sold in Ames, Iowa, between 2006 and 2010. Data cleaning is an essential step in the EDA process, involving handling missing values, dealing with outliers, addressing inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. In this project, you will learn various data cleaning techniques and best practices to ensure the dataset's quality and reliability for subsequent analysis tasks.

These projects provide practical examples and hands-on experience with EDA techniques, feature engineering, and data cleaning. You will have the opportunity to work with real-world datasets, gain insights from data visualizations, and apply various data manipulation and preprocessing techniques to extract meaningful information.

Feel free to explore the projects, modify the code, and adapt the techniques to your own datasets and analysis tasks.

Happy Exploratory Data Analysis!
